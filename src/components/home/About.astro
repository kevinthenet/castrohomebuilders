          Castro Home Builders is a company that started from the ground up and has been in the Bay
          Area for over 20 years, building houses from scratch and helping people in the community
          make the most out of their homes. By remodeling, renovating, and reinvigorating the houses
          we work on, we are able to provide Bay Area families a fresh start or a new living space
          to enjoy. Castro Home Builders builds green; we reduce or eliminate negative impacts of
          construction and endeavor to create positive impact to the environment and global climate.
          Castro Home Builders is licensed, bonded, and insured.
