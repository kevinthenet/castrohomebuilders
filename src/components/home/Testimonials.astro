      'I know and worked with Victor as a professional. We conducted the seismic retrofit design for a project in San Jose. Victor was the contractor for that project and he did an excellent job for the project. He has a very good talent to coordinate and manage the project in different situations. He is also excellent in coordination with E.O.R. His prices are fair and I have him as our trusted contractor on our list as a Consulting engineer.',

Victor is a true craftsman, and the new spaces in our home came out beautifully.

Thankfully my fiance and I got a referral to Victor and his team at Castro Home Builders. Victor had attentiveness to detail from understanding our scope of work, meeting at the site for a walkthrough, and ultimately providing a thoughtful bid.  He was always responsive via phone call, email or text. Though we decided eventually to go with another general contractor, we had them as a top contender and will plan to use them should our project turn south with our selected GC.',

Victor and his team did a great deal of the project.  He was very helpful walking us through the project, answering a lot of questions with a great deal of patience.  He was knowledgeable and responsive.  He provided lots of good suggestions to help decision making.  We are very grateful for his help.',
